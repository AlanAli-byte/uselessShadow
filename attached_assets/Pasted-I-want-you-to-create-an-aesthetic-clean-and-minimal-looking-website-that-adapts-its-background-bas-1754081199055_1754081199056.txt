I want you to create an aesthetic, clean, and minimal-looking website that adapts its background based on user input. The goal is to allow users to input their height, time, direction facing, GPS coordinates, local weather forecasts, and shoe brand to predict how long their shadow will be on a user-selected date and time, along with an interpretation of what that might say about their soul‚Äôs silhouette. Users should be able to manually enter their city or coordinates or use IST, and the site must process this data using ‚Äúquantum shade algorithms‚Äù to display results in various measurements like millimeters, feet, horse lengths, Planck's length, and light-years not in any useful length. also provide city search option.

The final website should feature a clean and visually pleasing UI with all selection options in dropdown menus. Include a calendar and clock for date and time selection and ensure precise shadow measurements based on trigonometric calculations. The design must be adaptable to reflect local weather conditions, while also ensuring a smooth user experience. 

For example, the website might include a feature that visually represents shadow lengths in a creative way, such as an interactive graphic, and provide engaging insights about the user‚Äôs input. Ensure that the elements are well-organized, and that the overall aesthetic is harmonious and minimalistic, prioritizing user engagement and clarity throughout the interface. The length of a shadow can be calculated using trigonometry, based on the object's height and the sun's position in the sky.

The fundamental equation to find the shadow length ($L$) is:

$$L = \frac{h}{\tan(\alpha)}$$

Here, **$h$** is the height of the object, and **$\alpha$** is the **sun's altitude angle**‚Äîits angle above the horizon. The main challenge is calculating this angle, $\alpha$, which changes based on your location, the date, and the time of day.

### ## The Complete Equation

Calculating the sun's altitude angle ($\alpha$) is a multi-step process. The formula for $\alpha$ is:

$$\sin(\alpha) = \sin(\phi)\sin(\delta) + \cos(\phi)\cos(\delta)\cos(H)$$



Where:
* **$\alpha$** = Sun's altitude angle. You will solve for this.
* **$\phi$** (phi) = Your **latitude** (e.g., for Thrissur, India, it's about 10.5¬∞ N).
* **$\delta$** (delta) = The **solar declination**. This depends on the day of the year.
* **$H$** = The **hour angle**. This depends on the time of day.

### ## Step-by-Step Calculation Guide

To use the formula, you need to find the values for solar declination ($\delta$) and the hour angle ($H$).

#### **Step 1: Calculate Solar Declination ($\delta$)**

The solar declination depends on the day of the year, represented by $N$ (where $N=1$ for January 1st, $N=32$ for February 1st, etc.).

$$\delta \approx -23.45^{\circ} \times \cos\left[ \frac{360}{365} \times (N + 10) \right]$$

This angle represents the tilt of the Earth relative to the sun on a given day.

#### **Step 2: Calculate the Hour Angle ($H$)**

The hour angle is based on the **local solar time**, not your clock time. It represents the sun's movement across the sky, where every hour is 15¬∞.

**A. First, find the Equation of Time ($EoT$) in minutes.**
The $EoT$ corrects for the difference between the mean (clock) time and the apparent (solar) time.

Let $B = \frac{360}{365} \times (N - 81)$
$$EoT \approx 9.87\sin(2B) - 7.53\cos(B) - 1.5\sin(B)$$

**B. Next, convert your clock time to Local Solar Time (LST).**

$$\text{LST (in hours)} = \text{Clock Time (in hours)} + \frac{EoT}{60} + \frac{4 \times (\text{Standard Meridian} - \text{Local Longitude})}{60}$$
* **Clock Time:** The time on your watch.
* **Standard Meridian:** The reference longitude for your time zone (for India, this is 82.5¬∞ E).
* **Local Longitude:** Your precise longitude.

**C. Finally, calculate the Hour Angle ($H$).**
The hour angle is 0¬∞ at solar noon, negative in the morning, and positive in the afternoon.

$$H = 15^{\circ} \times (\text{LST} - 12)$$

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Sun's Altitude ($\alpha$)**

Now, plug your latitude ($\phi$), declination ($\delta$), and hour angle ($H$) into the altitude formula:

$$\alpha = \arcsin\left[ \sin(\phi)\sin(\delta) + \cos(\phi)\cos(\delta)\cos(H) \right]$$

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Shadow Length ($L$)**

With the sun's altitude angle ($\alpha$) and the object's height ($h$), you can find the shadow length:

$$L = \frac{h}{\tan(\alpha)}$$

### ## Important Notes

* **Weather:** This calculation assumes clear skies. If it's cloudy, there will be no distinct shadow to measure. üå•Ô∏è
* **Direction Facing:** For a simple vertical object (like a pole or a person standing straight), the direction it's "facing" is **irrelevant** to the shadow's *length*. It only affects the shadow's *direction*.
* **Surface:** This calculation assumes the shadow is cast on a flat, horizontal surface.
* **Sunrise/Sunset:** The formula becomes less accurate near sunrise and sunset when $\alpha$ is close to 0, as atmospheric refraction can slightly alter the sun's apparent position. At night, the sun is below the horizon, so it does not cast a shadow.

The equation provided in the previous answer naturally accounts for this. When you perform the calculation using a nighttime hour, the result for the sun's altitude angle ($\alpha$) will be a negative number.

* **Sun's Altitude (${\alpha}$):** A positive angle for $\alpha$ means the sun is above the horizon. A negative angle for $\alpha$ means the sun is below the horizon.
* **Shadow Length ($L$):** If the sun's altitude $\alpha$ is zero or negative ($\alpha \le 0$), a solar shadow does not exist. The concept of shadow length becomes undefined as there is no direct sunlight. üåÉ

While the sun doesn't cast a shadow at night, other bright celestial objects, like a full moon, can cast very faint shadows. The principle to calculate the length of a lunar shadow would be the same, but you would need to use the **moon's altitude angle** instead of the sun's.
