# **SoulShade** 🌒  
> _“Measure your shadow. Interpret your soul.”_

## 🧾 Basic Details

### **Team Name**: Arcane

### **Team Members**
- **Team Lead**: Alan P Ali – GEC Thrissur

## 🎯 Project Description

**SoulShade** is an interactive, minimalist web experience where users input personal and environmental data—like height, GPS coordinates, time, direction, shoe brand—and receive not only an eerily accurate measurement of their shadow but also a philosophical interpretation of their "soul’s silhouette."

---

## 🚫 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

You walk outside, the sun is shining, and yet—how long *is* your shadow? What does that say about your existential wavelength, your emotional stretch, your... shoe choice?

Nobody asked. But we answered.

---

## ✅ The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

By combining quantum shade algorithms™, trigonometric wizardry, and pure design elegance, we created a website that calculates your shadow length in absurd units—Planck’s length? Sure. Horse lengths? Why not. All with weather-aware visuals, soul-searching insights, and a UI that vibes with your climate.

- **Frameworks**: None (to maintain purity of aesthetic)
- **Libraries**: 
  - Luxon (for date/time handling)
  - Leaflet.js (for map + location)
  - SunCalc.js (for solar angle)
- **Tools**: GitHub, Figma (UI), Netlify (deployment)

### 🔧 Hardware (Your body is the hardware)

## ⚡ Shadow Calculation Engine

### Formula:
```math
L = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{H}{\tan(\theta)}, & \text{if } \theta > 0 \\
\infty, & \text{if } \theta \leq 0
\end{cases}
```

- `H` = height of the user  
- `θ` = solar elevation angle (based on date, time, latitude, longitude)

Weather just adds soul to the visual. Shadows still exist behind the clouds.
